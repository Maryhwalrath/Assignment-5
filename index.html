        <p>Scout is a 1 1/2 year old black short-haired house cat. She is a "hemingway cat," meaning she has an extra toe or "thumb" on every paw. Keeping with the literary theme, she was named "Scout" after the character in Learn more about this exceptionally friendly and fun cat on this webpage.</p>

            Scout was adopted from a local resident but has gotten her veterinary work done through the Rochester Community Animal Clinic. They offer low-cost services to the Rochester comunity and are a great resource. Be sure to adopt from local shelters which are full of cats in need of homes.
